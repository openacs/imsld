    modes for the professor: off-line mode and on-line mode.</p><p>In the off-line mode only the professor will have access and he/she
    will be able to see all the plays, acts, properties, conditions, etc.
    Definitively, all the things that are described in an IMS-LD document. But
    this information of the XML package will not include the mapping between
    roles and members of the .LRN course or community. It is the professor who
    must do this association before running the IMS-LD for concrete students.
    The interface will allow to select the students inside a concrete .LRN
    course. This tool will allow to assign students and professors (or other
    groups if exists) to the roles defined in the IMS-LD file.</p><p>On the other hand, in the on-line mode, it is visualized the IMS-LD
    when it is running. It will give to both the teacher and the student
    (staff and learner) an overview of the activities in the workflow, i.e.
    the visualization of the play, as well as their current status.</p><p>For the teacher, the viewer also offers in on-line mode the
    possibility of seeing the properties and conditions, tracking the
    students, watching the users in every activity of an act, etc. The teacher
    is able to view more details in every act and see who has done what.
    He/she can verify if a given test is too difficult and the students can't
    continue with the flow of the course, or if the teaching method is not
    working as planned. The viewer shows the list of acts that conforms the
    play, as well as the activities that conforms each act, the list of
    students that are part of that given course, etc. It display this
    information in a graphical way, in order to make the information easy to
    understand. It will also display links to the .LRN services involved, in
    case the teacher wants to make use of the functionalities of that specific
    package (because eventh ough we make use of them, it doesn't mean that we
    are replacing them). In the future the teacher will be able to edit the
    sequence of activities from the viewer, when the editor is
    finished.</p><p>On the other hand, the viewer offers the possibility to the students
    to see their status inside the play. They can see how much have completed
    and how much they have yet to complete. Of course, when viewing the IMS-LD
    level B, this current status is not that easy to see nor to reproduce,
    because the workflow can depend on the students themselves because of the
    properties and conditions. Even more, there can be sometimes that this
    status is impossible to represent (we mean, the exact path that the
    student has not completed yet), because the conditions change during the
    lifetime of the course. This gets even more complicated when viewing
    IMS-LD level C, because it adds the notifications, which combined with the
    conditions and properties of level B, can make the play to follow a path
    impossible to represent. But no matter what level the student is viewing,
    he is able to see what he or she have already done.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch02s02.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch02.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch02s04.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Editing IMS Learning Design Documents </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> IMS-LD Player</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
