    the moment (which could be based on conditions) in which a role is going
    to do an activity and which materials and services are going to be used.
    Integrating IMD LD into .LRN, the professor is able to use all the
    services provided by .LRN, such as forums for asynchronous interaction,
    chat as synchronous interaction, assessments to evaluate the e-learning
    process (students and contents), the evaluation package (grade book) to
    support a a variety of learning and support activities, etc. And all of
    this is done in a centralized way, from an IMS-LD editor.</p><p>The main idea is to load an IMS-LD document (which is an XML
    document) and play it. To play an IMS-LD document is nothing more than to
    perform the activities prescribed in the document with its related
    environment which defines the learning objects and services, and this is
    when the interaction with the .LRN services begin. The IMS-LD package is
    able to detect and indicate what .LRN service is the most indicated one to
    perform a given IMS-LD service. The activities will follow the sequence
    prescribed in the IMS-LD document, each member of the course will perform
    a specific set of activities according to the member's role inside the
    course. The professor is able to decide the different roles that the
    course supports, and which role can do what at any given time during the
    course life, and following the defined sequence.</p><p>With the IMS-LD package, the professor is able to let the learner
    choose between the activities, make the learner follow a specific sequence
    or use a combination of both sequenced and learner's choice activities.
    And that's not all, the professor is also able to define the sequence of
    the learning activities using conditions and properties that change
    according to the learner behavior during the course (as defined at the the
    level B of the Learning Design Specification). Moreover .LRN can take
    advantage from the power notification system in order to send messages and
    set new activities based on events (as defined at the level C of the
    Learning Design Specification)</p><p>The IMS-LD package provides an IMS-LD editor, an IMS-LD player, an
    IMS-LD viewer and an IMS-LD importer/exporter. Each one of these is
    described later on this document.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch01s01.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch01.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch01s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Introduction </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Pedagogical Flexibility</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
