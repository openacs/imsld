But this information of the XML package will not include the mapping between roles and members of the .LRN course or community. It is the professor who must do this association before running the IMS LD for concrete students. The interface will allow to select the students inside a concrete .LRN course. This tool will allow assignate students and professors (or other groups if exists) to the roles defined in the IMS LD file.</p><p>On the other hand, in the on-line mode, it is visualized the IMS LD when it is running. It will give to both the teacher and the student (staff and learner) an overview of the activities in the workflow, i.e. the visualization of the play, as well as their current status.</p><p>For the teacher, the viewer also offers in on-line mode the possibility of seeing the properties and conditions, tracking the students, watching the users in every activity of an act, etc. The teacher is able to view more details in every act and see who has done what. He/she can verify if a given test is too difficult and the students can't continue with the flow of the course, or if the teaching method is not working as planned. The viewer shows the list of acts that conforms the play, as well as the activities that conforms each act, the list of students that are part of that given course, etc. It display this information in a graphical way, in order to make the information easy to understand. It will also display links to the .LRN services involved, in case the teacher wants to make use of the functionalities of that specific package (because eventhough we make use of them, it doesn't mean that we are replacing them). In the future the teacher will be able to edit the sequence of activities from the viewer, when the editor is finished.</p><p>On the other hand, the viewer offers the possibility to the students to see their status inside the play. They can see how much have completed and how much they have yet to complete. Of course, when viewing the IMS LD level B, this current status is not that easy to see nor to reproduce, because the workflow can depend on the students themselves because of the properties and contitions. Even more, there can be sometimes that this status is impossible to represent (we mean, the exact path that the student has not completed yet), because the conditions change during the lifetime of the course. This gets even more complicated when viewing IMS LD level C, because it adds the notifications, wich combined with the conditions and properties of level B, can make the play to follow a path impossible to represent. But no matter what level the student is viewing, he is able to see what he or she have already done.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch02s03.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch02.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch02s05.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">3.&nbsp;Editing IMS Learning Design Documents&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;5.&nbsp;IMS LD Player</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
