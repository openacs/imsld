    roles of the unit of learning the different activities in a sequence
    ordered way based on the properties and conditions.</p><p>When deciding how the player should interact with the user, we
    thought two different implementations:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Show a little portlet to the user that indicates the next
        activity to complete, showing the corresponding link to the
        appropriate .LRN package.</p></li><li><p>Render all the information in a single window, in a centralized
        way. Something that the LORS package currently do when playing an
        SCORM document.</p></li></ol></div><p>After analyzing each one of these approaches, we concluded that
    rendering all the information in a single window was the better option,
    because we think is more simple for the users (teachers and students) to
    centralize the visualization instead of following different links, and
    also it can give us some kind of control of what the user is doing, and we
    can be sure of what the user is actually seeing on his/her screen.</p><p>Also, for example if the activity is a forum and we redirect the
    user to this forum, the user can easily get distracted and end up reading
    a forum that does not form part of the activity. In the other hand, if we
    render the forum inside a centralized window, we have the control on the
    user's window, and by using some kind of frame, we can easily show any
    important message to the user and be sure (well, not entirely), that
    he/she read it. Besides, in this centralized window we can show in the
    bottom the activities that are completed and, when possible, the ones that
    are yet to complete.</p><p>Therefore the selected option is the single window. The users
    (students, professors, etc.) will see in the single window in a concrete
    moment of time, some resource associated with an activity. The user will
    have at the left hand a list of the possible activities that he/she can
    see in a concrete moment (this depends on the design of the course). The
    student can select between the activities presented. Also for each
    activity it will be a description that will be shown always if the current
    activity is selected by the user (this description will appear in a little
    space), and also the user will be able to choice between the different
    resources of the associated environment of the activity. Therefore the
    student will select between the given resources for the activity. These
    resources can be any of the .LRN services or learning objects as files
    that comes for example in the IMS CP.</p><p>The activities presented to the different roles will change in the
    time depending on the different properties and conditions. For example, it
    can change depending on the evaluations of the professors, on the results
    of the assessments, on the user models, etc. Therefore not all the users
    will see the same information because it is personalized depending on
    conditions. Also different paths in the workflow can be defined based on
    roles.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch02s03.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch02.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Viewing an IMS-LD Document and Groups assignation </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 3. Use Cases</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
